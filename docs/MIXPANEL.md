## üë§ User Properties

The following user properties are tracked and updated:

- `userId` - Unique user identifier
- `email` - User's email address
- `name` - User's display name
- `referralCode` - User's referral code
- `totalReferrals` - Count of successful referrals

- `total_calculations` - Running count of calculations performed

## üîß Implementation Details

### Mixpanel Service

The main service is located at `/src/lib/mixpanel.ts` and provides:

- Type-safe event tracking
- Automatic property enrichment
- User identification and property management
- Super properties for all events
- Time tracking for duration metrics

### Mixpanel Provider

The provider at `/src/components/providers/MixpanelProvider.tsx`:

- Initializes Mixpanel on app load
- Automatically tracks user login/logout
- Provides `useMixpanel` hook for components

### Usage Example

```tsx
import { useMixpanel } from '@/components/providers/MixpanelProvider';
import { MixpanelEvents } from '@/lib/mixpanel';

function MyComponent() {
  const mixpanel = useMixpanel();
  
  const handleAction = () => {
    // Track an event
    mixpanel.track(MixpanelEvents.FEATURE_USED, {
      feature: 'example_feature',
      value: 123
    });
    
    // Track with timing
    mixpanel.timeEvent('Long_Process');
    // ... do something
    mixpanel.track('Long_Process', { result: 'success' });
  };
  
  return <button onClick={handleAction}>Do Something</button>;
}
```

## üìà Key Metrics to Monitor

### User Acquisition
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users
- Signup conversion rate
- Referral success rate

### Engagement
- Average calculations per user
- Calculator feature usage (memory, operations)
- Onboarding completion rate

### Retention
- User retention curves
- Feature adoption rates
- Session frequency and duration

### Referrals
- Viral coefficient (referrals per user)
- Referral conversion rate
- Top referrers

## üîç Debugging

### Development Mode
In development, all events are logged to the console with `[Mixpanel]` prefix.

### Testing Events
1. Open browser developer console
2. Look for `[Mixpanel]` logs
3. Check Network tab for `api.mixpanel.com` requests

### Common Issues

**Events not showing up in Mixpanel:**
- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_MIXPANEL_TOKEN` is set correctly
- Verify the token is from the correct project
- Events may take a few minutes to appear in Mixpanel

**User properties not updating:**
- Ensure user is identified with `mixpanel.identify()`
- Check that properties are being set after identification

## üîê Privacy Considerations

- No sensitive data (passwords, payment info) is tracked
- User IDs are used instead of personally identifiable information where possible
- Consider implementing user consent for analytics tracking
- Mixpanel respects Do Not Track browser settings
